# The Market

It is an e-commerce website built for the sale of products online. Throughout this project, we have primarily focused on adding products to the users' carts for them to purchase or delete. It is possible for the user to increase or decrease the amount of items in the cart. It will then be possible for the user to make a payment and receive the order successfully. Additionally, the Project uses the mail facilities to communicate with its users.
